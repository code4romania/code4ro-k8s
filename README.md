# Code4ro k8s manifests

[![License: MPL 2.0][ico-license]][link-license]

This repository contains the k8s manifest for all the applications in the Code4ro platform.

### ArgoCD

The k8s cluster is using [ArgoCD](https://cd.code4.ro) to automatically deploy manifests when a new change is detected.

The flow is as follow:

1. User adds a new tag in application git repository
2. CI kicks in in that repository and builds the new image
3. The image is pushed to docker hub with that specific tag
4. A new commit is made by the CI/user on this repo in which we change the image version in the manifest (wait for the GHA that pushes the image to DockerHub to end successfuly)
5. ArgoCD will detect the change in this repo and apply the manifests to the k8s cluster

ArgoCD projects:

- **_infra_**: cert-manager, sealed-secrets and argocd. `infra/argo-apps-infra.yaml` is the root ArgoCD Application for `infra/argo-apps`. `infra/argo-apps` store the ArgoCD Applications.
- **_apps_**: all applications manifests. `./apps/argo-apps/apps.yaml` is the root ArgoCD Application for `apps`. `apps` store the ArgoCD Applications.

### Sealed Secrets

Encrypt secrets and store them on git. Below is an example of how to create secrets with kubeseal.

```
# Create a yaml-encoded Secret somehow:
# (note use of `--dry-run` - this is just a local file!)
echo -n bar | kubectl create secret generic mysecret --dry-run=client --from-file=foo=/dev/stdin -o yaml >secret.yaml

# This is the important bit:
kubeseal --controller-namespace sealed-secrets --controller-name sealed-secrets --format yaml <secret.yaml >sealed-secret.yaml

# At this point sealed-secret.yaml is safe to upload to Github

# Test it
kubectl get secret my-secret
```

### Cert Manager

For automatically regenerating certificates with Lets Encrypt using Route53 integration.
